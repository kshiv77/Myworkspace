         <small style="color: red;">They are filled with potential, strength, and the power to contribute positively to society. From an early age, girls exhibit remarkable resilience and determination, challenging stereotypes and breaking barriers in various fields. With access to education and opportunities, they blossom into leaders, scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, and change-makers.</small>
